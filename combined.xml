        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The Fallacies of Management — The Network is Reliable</h3><blockquote>Turns out management is closer to engineering than we let on.</blockquote><p>For your entire IC career you’ll hear that management is not a “promotion” — it’s an entirely separate discipline. You’ll be told that the skills you learned as an engineer don’t translate well to being a manager and often are a hinderance.</p><p>This is only half of the truth.</p><p>The rest of it is that if you’re a truly good engineer, you don’t think in code — you think in systems. You understand that the feature you’re adding to your product is just one of many that need to interact with each other to produce something usable. This same skillset can help you if you find yourself in management — it can give you a firm base on which you can build.</p><p>Here’s a list of the fallacies of distributed computing that we’ll cover — each post will be about a different fallacy and, hopefully, help you connect what you know about distributed computing to people.</p><ol><li>The Network is Reliable</li><li>Latency is Zero</li><li>Bandwidth is Infinite</li><li>The Network is Secure</li><li>Topology Doesn’t Change</li><li>There is One Administrator</li></ol><h3>The Network is Reliable</h3><p>Fallacy: Messages always get delivered</p><p>When you’re a new manager, you think communication is easy: People mostly want to do a good job, so you just need to say the thing and people will do the thing.</p><p>But somewhere between your all-hands presentation, your carefully worded Slack update, and the actual code shipped two weeks later… something got lost.</p><p>You thought the network was reliable.</p><p>In distributed systems the assumption is “messages always arrive”.</p><p>Managers often fall for the same trap. We say something in a meeting, or we write it in an email. We slack it. And we assume it was received, interpreted how we intended, and then acted upon in the expected manner.</p><p>In a distributed system, a message is a single structured payload comprising of explicit information. In management, that message is squishier. It’s actually two messages masquerading as one:</p><ul><li>The words you say</li><li>The meaning that’s reconstructed</li></ul><p>And they are almost never the same.</p><p>Not only is the network unreliable — but it turns out that in management, even if the message is received you can’t believe that it was received as intended.</p><p>You might say: “Let’s keep this sprint focused.”</p><p>One person hears: “No experiments allowed.”</p><p>Another hears: “Just don’t miss your estimates again.”</p><p>A third… doesn’t hear it at all. They’re still thinking about yesterday’s architecture review.</p><p>To borrow from Shannon’s information theory, a message is just noise until the receiver has the right <em>context</em> — the shared encoding and decoding protocol. In other words: people don’t understand what you say — they understand what they <em>think</em> you meant.</p><p>Being understood is not a matter of merely reproducing what someone else says, but of interpreting what is said in one’s own way.</p><p>This is the philosophical underpinning of hermeneutics, the study of interpretation. And it’s why repeating the same words rarely helps. If someone didn’t “get it” the first time, saying it again verbatim just gives them another chance to misinterpret it the same way — and enforce their alternative understanding.</p><p>Another way to think about this process is as follows:</p><ul><li>The words arrive</li><li>Meaning is constructed by the individual</li><li>There’s no guarantee that your intent survived</li></ul><p>This means that a key component of effective management is repeating your idea with different words every time. In the same way that GPS requires multiple data satellite data points for triangulation, your ideas need multiple routes to your team.</p><p>In distributed systems you use retries, acknowledgements, and idempotency.</p><p>In teams you use 1:1s, Slack posts, Email Newsletters, and Town Halls. Each repitition is a new signal allowing your team to converge on your true intent.</p><p>This is all about redundancy and delivery in a high-failure network.</p><h3>The People Factor</h3><p>Once you understand that your message is actually two parts, it turns out that as a manager the “second” part is most important and relevant to your work. The part about “meaning being constructed locally”</p><p>See that’s the crux of being a manager and what makes an organization so much more complicated than a distributed system.</p><p>Each person is the some of their experiences. Everyone had a different path to get to where they were right at this moment. Not just their lives, but in their day. Someone might be married. Someone might have just got a dog. Someone might have lost a loved one. Someone might have gotten into an argument.</p><p>All of these are pieces of the whole and are represented in the person at this moment — and they can change in the very next.</p><p>This is the context that they are using the decipher your messaging.</p><p>Did they have a less-than-stellar performance review? Well maybe your message is taken a bit more critically.</p><p>Was it a great one? Maybe they think the message isn’t for them.</p><p>When I was younger I used to work at a Milestones — a restaurant chain without a kids section on the menu. I worked in the kitchen and I spent my morning shifts doing prep work. My job was everything from making mashed potatoes for the lunch shift, to portioning pastas for the line cooks.</p><p>As part of prepping mashed potatoes, one of the first steps is cutting mashed potatoes.</p><p>Months into the role, I managed to cut my finger pretty badly. Enough to warrant heading to the hospital and filling out workplace safety documentation. It was no ones fault but my own, I knew better, but I still positioned my fingers incorrectly. The resulting blood loss was enough that, coupled with my relatively low blood pressure, I passed out.</p><p>The following week we had a “kitchen all hands” where we went over different new menu items and over issues that the head chef was seeing. There were also mini-tutorials on things… and one of the tutorials was on proper knife safety.</p><p>It was pretty pointedly at me, and deservedly so. Word of my misadventure had no doubt gotten out. Kitchens are tough environments socially — there was probably going to be some good-natured ribbing. And some bad natured ribbing too. I’d probably get some kind of nickname. I resolved to pay closer attention to the tutorial so this never happened again.</p><p>After the tutorial I think I made some kind of comment to the head chef about how I appreciated the tutorial and it wouldn’t happen again. I did feel a bit called out by it, but clearly there was a need.</p><p>She heard my words — and also understood the intent behind them.</p><p>She said “This tutorial isn’t because of what happened — you’re not that important. We need to go over this at least twice a year.”</p><p>The message I had heard was simple: You did it wrong, here’s the right way to do it. We’re going to cover it because there can’t be another mistake like this.</p><p>But it was wrong — I brought all of my insecurities and problems to interpreting what was actually going on.</p><p>Chef repeated the message and clarified: This is not about calling you out — this is about safety first.</p><p>See the only message there was “here is information about knife safety”.</p><p>I brought all of my context and interpreted it as “You are bad and you should feel bad. Now I have to do this tutorial for everyone.”</p><p>She repeated: “This is not about you, this is about knife safety”.</p><p>The second time around, it landed as intended.</p><h3>TL;DR:</h3><p>In distributed systems, we assume messages might be lost — so we plan for retries and acknowledgements.</p><p>In management, assume the same. You’re not transmitting truth. You’re helping others rebuild it.</p><p>If it’s important, say it again. Say it differently. Say it until it’s reflected back to you in action.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=89cd2c958f6c" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><em>The Presentation of Self in Every Blog post</em></blockquote><p>I’ve been blogging for a number of years now, even though my website makes it seem like I stopped. You can check the wayback machine and see posts from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110507234835/http://xangelo.ca">2011</a> before composer was a thing in the PHP world, or you can jump back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050415040309/http://www.xangelo.com/">2005</a> when I was more focused on the design of the website than the content itself. I’ve tried almost every blogging platform out there, and a few that never made it off my hard-drive.</p><p>A few years ago I moved over to Hugo and static sites and decided to set up something a bit more barebones, but intentional. I bought in to the concepts behind POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere) and worked to make sure that my content would survive first. I wrote in markdown, published to my own git server (and GitHub as well) so that I could invoke GH Actions to actually build my website. You can check it out the behind the scenes <a href="https://github.com/AngeloR/angelor.github.io">here</a>. I actually really like this process, but I realized something.</p><p>POSSE and the IndieWeb would have you believe that your site should be the starting point for your content — I’ve come to believe that that’s the furthest thing from the truth.</p><h3>The Masks We Wear</h3><p>The truth is that you are not experienced homogeneously.</p><p>The truth is that just as you are the sum of your parts, you present those parts in various amounts. Each room you enter calls for a different mix of your many selves.</p><p>I am not the same person I am on X as I am on LinkedIn.</p><p>I am not the same person I am on Facebook as I am on Mastodon.</p><p>I am not the same person I am on Instagram as I am on Twitch.</p><p>The truth is that I shift tone and intention in every room I am in, based on the room itself. Erving Goffman talks about this extensively in his book “<strong><em>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life”;</em></strong> As the backdrop of our stage changes we present different sides of ourselves. This isn’t wrong or incorrect, and it isn’t being “fake”. This is the truth of who we are as people.</p><p>The sorts of comments I leave on a LinkedIn post are vastly different from what I leave on X. They’re both facets of who I am, but they exist within the bounds of those systems. The systems inform how I interact with them.</p><p>In that way, the POSSE mentality of “writing on your own site first” trades true authenticity for self-erasure.</p><p>A bold claim, to be sure, but the truth is that social platforms have become mirrors of facets of self. In the same way that the language you use when you text an older relative is different from the language used when you text a younger one.</p><h3>So what does this have to do with POSSE?</h3><p>By writing first on your own site, you miss tapping into the zeitgeist of the platform. When you are on LinkedIn, the type of content you see changes the way you interact with the platform. But it goes further than that — the WAY you even construct your post is different.</p><p>When X limits your count to a couple hundred characters, not only does it force you to to be brief and adjust language, but the very textbox to enter your tweet lends itself to the style and format of message. In the same way that the long form editor of Medium lends itself to larger posts.</p><p>POSSE ignores all of this and, instead, implicitly enforces a single-voice on what you write.</p><p>By writing on your own site first, you are forcing yourself to engage with different audiences in a way that doesn’t match their expectations. Long form posts on X are different from long form on Medium and are different from long form on LinkedIn — forcing a single writing interface over them doesn’t do them justice.</p><h3>From POSSE to EPOSS</h3><p>I’m proposing a shift in direction of POSSE, while maintaining the original goals: Engage Platforms, Own Site Syndication</p><p>Instead of writing on your own website and pushing to other platforms, I suggest the opposite. Write on the platforms that are meant for that style of writing. Engage with your audience where they are in a manner they are expecting. Syndicate back to your own website as a way of archiving and gathering the different parts of yourself in one location. If someone wants all of those, they can still get it — but you allow yourself the freedom to express yourself differently.</p><p>IndieWeb and POSSE is about control and ownership, but it does this at the cost of contextual expression and implicitly imposed homogenous authenticity. POSSE targets digital attrition, but ignores the benefits on the platforms entirely — a mechanism to express a facet of yourself wholly. You are a spectrum and foil of your environment, and that’s just as true in the digital world. By engaging with platforms FIRST, you start from where your context already lives. You speak in the language of the room you’re in. The backdrop matches the persona you are displaying in its fullness. Then you archive that.</p><p>Instead of syndicating one voice everywhere, EPOSS seeks to collect all of your voices in one place. If a platform disappears, it disappears. The content and interactions are still collected in your archive. And the community moves to the next place.</p><p>Your website isn’t the orgin, it’s the destination. It’s a museum and collection of all your selves across the internet.</p><h3>Technically Practical</h3><p>The same tools that power POSSE can power EPOSS, you just need to point them the other way.</p><p>For example, this post, even though it shows up on Medium, also appears on my website (<a href="https://xangelo.ca/posts/medium/posse-has-it-backwards/">https://xangelo.ca/posts/medium/posse-has-it-backwards/</a>). It does this because Medium supports RSS and I can use that RSS feed to generate a post in markdown and feed it back to Hugo. This particular script looks at the RSS feed defined at RSS_URL and writes markdown versions of it to content/posts/medium so that I can track which posts are being imported: <a href="https://github.com/AngeloR/angelor.github.io/blob/main/.github/scripts/medium_to_hugo.py">https://github.com/AngeloR/angelor.github.io/blob/main/.github/scripts/medium_to_hugo.py</a></p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/c7634bd7099d8b4a3c68e75789d29869/href">https://medium.com/media/c7634bd7099d8b4a3c68e75789d29869/href</a></iframe><p>I’ve connected this to my github actions to run this script every 30 minutes to pull in new content from medium.</p><p>EPOSS isn’t the antithesis of POSSE, it’s an evoluion.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ca9ab4d5b529" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Code Reviews are nothing more than a half-hearted attempt to avoid planning</blockquote><p>As a new startup with one or two engineers on staff, you’re very likely not doing code reviews. Engineers at this stage have a very deep understanding of the code — after all, they’ve probably written most of it. When it’s time for a new feature, these initial developers know exactly how they’re going to implement it given the architecture of their code base. Chances are, they keep their own work in a branch, and open a Pull Request or Merge Request, but they aren’t asking someone to take a look at it. Instead they’re making sure their changes work and they’re merging it in themselves. Often they’ll do this many times a day as they crank out features and bug fixes.</p><p>At some point things are going better than they were and this small group of engineers start adding more! Now you have 5 or 6 engineers, all with varying familiarity of your code base. This is generally the first time Code Reviews come about — and normally for good reason. Often someone has pushed some code to production that has broken things and the developers take a step back and realize that maybe before they push code, it’s best if they have others review it. Perhaps bugs like this can be caught next time. And so they come up with rules and reasons for why they need Code Reviews. Non technical managers think “Ah, this won’t happen again — we’re instituting code reviews now!”</p><p>We’ve all seen the reasons for Code Reviews:</p><ul><li>Find bugs further downstream</li><li>Propagation of Knowledge</li><li>Team Ownership</li><li>Double check functionality/architecture</li></ul><p>These are nonsense — Code Reviews in isolation almost always end up with the following results:</p><ul><li>Reviews languishing in a “Ready for Review” state</li><li>Drastic code architecture changes</li><li>Being “Approved” based on social standing of the developer opening the request</li></ul><p>Code Reviews are often seen as some kind of magic bullet to catching errors before they get merged into code bases. The ideal is that a developer gets a ticket, makes some code changes, and then shares those changes with everyone else on the team for feedback. The idea is that other developers, with perhaps more context, can catch potential issues or side-effects in the code that the developer doing the work may not have even known about.</p><p>Why the heck are you waiting until things are “Ready for Review” before you share you knowledge and context with the developer doing the task? Why are you telling them to “open a draft request as they go” so that you can share with them little tidbits of knowledge along the way.</p><p>Why do Code Reviews fail? Because it moves in-depth planning to the end of the development process once someone is already “done” mentally with a task.</p><h3>The Opposite of Code Reviews</h3><p>The opposite of Code Reviews isn’t NO code reviews.</p><p>The opposite of Code Reviews is Planning!</p><p>Let me regale you with tales of how development works in the Open Source world. I specifically pick the Open Source community because they operate the opposite way of most startups. Both have no budget, but OS communities have much longer (almost.. undefined in some cases) delivery times for new features. But not just any Open Source community — I’m specifically going to target communities that were around before 2008. Old Open Source. I’m doing this specifically to highlight not just the mechanisms that were used, but also how they contributed to this default of Planning over Code Reviews.</p><p>When a new feature was proposed — it didn’t just appear on an issue board somewhere. Instead someone had to find the mailing list for a piece of software, get ON that mailing list, and then send an email to the development group explaining in detail what your feature was. If you were not clear, chances are you’d simply receive a short email asking for more explanation about a certain part, or possibly just outright dismissal of your idea. In either case, you’d end up needing to explain yourself further.</p><p>At some point someone on the development team might agree that your idea should be a feature. At this point, they start digging into the code. They probably aren’t making the changes you need for your feature, but they’re validating how they would go about implementing it. A followup email you may receive would actually include code snippets, specific files/line-numbers to reference, and links to external documentation.</p><p>This all happens in public. Other developers that see that email may realize that they have more context, and will chime in with additional edge cases, more documentation, maybe more code! This will likely go on for a while. Days is obscenely fast. Weeks is more reasonable. Eventually what will happen is that you’ll end up with an email that details the goals for the feature, and a flurry of emails outlining the best way to go about it — complete with links to documentation, code, and even code snippets to implement the feature.</p><p>The goal for this email activity isn’t to code the feature — it’s to get it to the point that anyone can pick up this email chain and implement the feature based on the knowledge shared up front.</p><p>Once that’s done, the developer may still run into cases they didn’t think about and may message the group again. But often, things are planned out enough that the developer implementing the feature can solve the problem. This completed code is sent back to the group/maintainer for Integration. The “Code Review” at this stage is simply to make sure that things are happening as expected, to do one last check of the code, and to actually merge the changes in and test things.</p><p>Now, there’s plenty of problems with this process — but the Code Review is rarely one of them.</p><h3>The Advent of Code Reviews</h3><p>I want to place the blame squarely on GitHub for enabling and promoting Code Reviews, via mostly circumstantial evidence.</p><p>Prior to GitHub contributing to an Open Source project required you to get involved in the developer community for the project before submitting code. After GitHub anyone can stumble across a repo and open a Pull Request with code changes — without discussing anything at all.</p><p>That mentality has premeated current development processes everywhere. Now when you start work on a task, instead of having all the information/discussion up front the developer is expected to seek it out. They’re expected to not just figure out that they may be missing information, but also figure out the best person to ask to find out what they’re missing. The developer is immediately set up for failure unless they already know the codebase well. At any sufficiently large enough project, that is very unlikely to be the case.</p><p>Instead you end up open a code review that sits in review for days while engineers chime in with little fixes, slightly better ways of going about things, while you scramble to implement them and get your code reviewed again and again. Of course, some places recognize this problem and simply outlaw large scale architecture changes at this stage even if they are completely warranted.</p><p>See the problem isn’t that the Code Review is bad — it’s that the Code Review is the first time anyone has actually looked at the code related to the problem.</p><p>## The Solution to Code Reviews<br>There isnt one.</p><p>All planning up front without a deadline isn’t helpful. All work without planning is pointless. But where your team draws the line between planning that’s “good enough” and the length of time attributed to feature development changes frequently. It changes based on team composition, it changes based on the company state, it changes based on the market your company operates in. The only thing that’s certain is that the amount of planning from feature to feature will be different.</p><p>You have to be able to make a call at some point that the planning is enough. But if your planning doesn’t include pseudo code and links to code in the project, chances are it’s not enough planning.</p><p>Planning should not be a single person event either. The whole team that would participate in the code review should be participating in the planning process as well.</p><p>Once the planning is done and a developer completes the code change, the Code Review needs to happen. At this point generally it’s about testing change rather than re-architecting how the change is made. When we’re at this stage, there’s even more tools at our disposal!</p><p>Unit tests, Integration Tests, Synthetic/BlackBox Tests — all of these can help ease the time code spends stuck in code reviews. By minimizing the time spent in code reviews, and maximizing the time spent in planning instead we can achieve things like:</p><ul><li>Actually find bugs further downstream and upstream</li><li>Propagation of Knowledge throughout the team</li><li>Team Ownership of a feature</li><li>Double check functionality/architecture</li></ul><p>How fun.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=36b72a659de4" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content>
